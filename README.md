# taglang.io

My personal website and blog, built using Vue.js as the framework. For deployment, requires a server that supports PHP.

Running locally requires an installation of PHP that is accessible in your PATH.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run e2e tests
npm run e2e

# run all tests
npm test
```
